# Quiz-Time

A multiple choice timed quiz.

This quiz is about the Tyrannosaurus Rex, easily one of the most incredible dinosaurs to ever roam the Earth.

When the Start button is clicked, a countdown is initiated and the user is presented with a total of 7 questions. 
When the timer reaches zero, the user is shown text declaring GAME OVER!

When the final question is answered, the time remaining in seconds is the users score. They can input that score, which is subsequently saved in local storage.

Thank you for your time!
